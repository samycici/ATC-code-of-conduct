The ATC - Agile Testers Conference - it's a non-profit event/conference which the main goal is to promote the exchange of experience between software test/developers professionals of Brazil and the world.

This code of conduct will be applied to all attendees and speakers to protect every one of moral damage and miss conduct behavior.

We dedicated ourselves to promote a respectful and free from harassment environment for all. We don't tolerate any type of harassment or intimidation from any participant.

It's not allowed to use images, activities or material that have sexual content, race and ethnicity abuse, sexual orientation or gender identity abuse, or any discrimination of all sort of natures. 

We understand harassment as:
* Offensive comments, verbally or electronic, related to the personal characteristics such as race origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and also images/memes with sexual content, racist, homophobic and with any sort discrimination content.
* Intimidation and aggressive behavior
* Bullying;
* Stalking;
* Photos or recordings that can generate embarrassment

Participants are expected to immediately comply with requests to discontinue any harassment or bullying behavior. Be kind to others. Do not insult or offend other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that jokes about harassment, sexism, racism or exclusion are not appropriate for our event.


Any participant who violates such rules may be invited to withdraw, at the sole discretion of the organizers of the event.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers may take appropriate action from alerts to the offender to the prohibition of their participation in other events promoted by members of the organization individually or collectively or even alert the Police.
